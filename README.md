===============

Bootstrap is an Ansible playbook that you can use to set up and immediately secure a brand new server, such as a fresh Linode. This playbook is inspired and largely based off of Bryan Kennedy's excellent post My First 5 Minutes On A Server; Or, Essential Security for Linux Servers. There's also some stuff from Linode's own Getting Started and Securing Your Server guides.
